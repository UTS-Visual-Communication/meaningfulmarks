# Class Overview for Generative Design and Interactive Image Task

## Week 11
#### Task 1: Generative Poster Task (Time: Approximately 1hr)
First of all you will be leading students through a generative poster task, this will be familiar to you from your first year. This year we are only doing the 'dot and tape' algorithm. We will be giving the students an algorithm, a set of step by step instructions that they themselves will carry out by hand. This is to give them some insight into the generative possibilities of using code to materialise design. How a single algorithm can create a unique compositional variations from the set of rules.

1. Get students into groups of 4-5 and give them a poster and a pack (includes dots, tape and instructions).
1. Get students to tape up or pin their poster to the wall so it is easy for them to work on as a group.
1. Before they begin please prep them for thoughtfully undertaking the task: Although students are following a set of instructions this does not mean that as designers they can carry out the task in a thoughtless manner and just let the algorithm do its thing. As designers they still have important decisions to make. What colours out of what they are given will they use, how might they combine them? And with each step they can think about how they want to be an input into how the algorithm works, will a line this way rather than another way lead to a more successful composition? At want point is the work finished? To get them started thinking about this they can take a look at what is in their kit and think about what colours they might like to use (they don't have to use all of them).
1. Students will need to show some documentation of this task for their reflection. Get them to nominate someone in their group to document some points in their process. They can just do this with a smart phone.
1. Get them to read through the instructions in full before they begin. 
1. As students are working on their poster, please give them feedback or encouragement with how they are going with the task.
1. Once they have all finished please take a moment to have the groups walk around the room and to see what happened with everyone elses posters so they can see the variation from a simple set of instructions.
1. We then have two code examples available on UTS Online that they can open up.

#### An Image That Can Change





### Week 12
1. Take students through the colour, fill and stroke commands. There is a file in the folder up on UTSOnline from last week. Similar to going through the draw commands last week you can step through the commands with them.
1. Then. For the computer labs we asked them to bring in their  sketch on paper or in a graphics program of their visual form and how it changes. They can use the grid sheet that was provided in class, if you no longer have this sheet a PDF of it is available on UTSOnline see Subject Documents > Meaningful Marks. 
With your group do a 'pin-up' in class and get each student to discuss their design and what it does (this could be showing their sketch on paper or in a graphics program or if they have started to program it). They may want to edit their design a little in response to any suggestions from you or their peers. 
If they have not done a design they can spend time doing one in class. If they have they can start coding up their designs into the base-file structure from last week.
You can then spend the rest of class helping them to code their forms
