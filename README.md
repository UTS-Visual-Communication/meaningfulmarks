# Class Overview for Generative Design and Interactive Image Task

## Week 11
### Task 1: Generative Poster Task (Time: Approximately 1hr)
First of all you will be leading students through a generative poster task. 


### Week 12
1. Take students through the colour, fill and stroke commands. There is a file in the folder up on UTSOnline from last week. Similar to going through the draw commands last week you can step through the commands with them.
1. Then. For the computer labs we asked them to bring in their  sketch on paper or in a graphics program of their visual form and how it changes. They can use the grid sheet that was provided in class, if you no longer have this sheet a PDF of it is available on UTSOnline see Subject Documents > Meaningful Marks. 
With your group do a 'pin-up' in class and get each student to discuss their design and what it does (this could be showing their sketch on paper or in a graphics program or if they have started to program it). They may want to edit their design a little in response to any suggestions from you or their peers. 
If they have not done a design they can spend time doing one in class. If they have they can start coding up their designs into the base-file structure from last week.
You can then spend the rest of class helping them to code their forms
